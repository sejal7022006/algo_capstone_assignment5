# 📌 3. Dijkstra + Prim (Algorithm 3)  
### (Fully corrected graph-generating version)

### *Graph Observations*
- *Dijkstra* time increases almost linearly with number of nodes.
- *Prim's MST* time remains even lower, also near-linear.
- Memory usage shows a slow, smooth rise because more nodes require more table space.

### *Conclusion*
> Graph algorithms (Shortest Path + MST) scale extremely well and  
> are used in *real-world route engines like Google Maps, Swiggy, Amazon logistics*.

These algorithms provide:
- Fast route cost estimation  
- Efficient connectivity structure (MST)
