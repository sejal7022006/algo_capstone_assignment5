# 📌 2. Greedy Parcel Selection + DP Time Window Check (Algorithm 2)

### *Graph Observations*
- Time graph is nearly flat, showing very small increase with more customers.
- Memory graph is also nearly constant.
- Greedy selection + DP constraint validation is extremely efficient.

### *Conclusion*
> This is the *fastest algorithm* among all four.  
It is practical and scalable to very large numbers of deliveries.
